# Dental Office Virtual Assistant


This project aims to develop a chatbot that, for the moment live on the dental clinik website only, can help patients with their questions and appointments. The chatbot uses Custom question answering and Conversational language understanding of Azure AI Cognitive Services for Language to understand and respond to patient queries, and to schedule appointments.



The diagram below illustrates the application's architecture, and it's components and how they interact with each other:
